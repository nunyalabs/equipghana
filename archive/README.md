# Archive Folder

This directory contains legacy or unused files retained for reference but excluded from deployment builds.

Files moved here:
- weekly-report.js (replaced by report.js)
- HTC.html (legacy standalone form)
- MODULAR_ARCHITECTURE.md (design reference)
- REGISTER_TEMPLATES.md (legacy template system)
- EXCEL_TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md (Excel import drafting guide)
- USER_CREATION_FIX.md (one-off migration note)
- USER_MANAGEMENT.md (documentation)

Only active runtime sources remain at project root; build script targets those for `dist/`.
